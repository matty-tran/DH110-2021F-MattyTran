# DH110 assignment02 Usability Testing 

## Assignment Description 
In this assignment, I conducted a pilot usability test for the [Washington State Department of Transportation website.](https://wsdot.wa.gov/) 
The website contains infomation regarding the various forms of transportation in the state of Washington, including ferries, public transit, and automobiles. 
Participants were prompted to complete three tasks that simulated real-world tasks that users would perform. 
Prior to testing, the main usability issues were disorganization, sizing issues and mass text that makes searching for information diffcult, and lack of visual aids. 

The test was conducted online via Zoom where the participant shared their screen which was recorded. 
Participants also used a [Google form](https://forms.gle/6LXRowDsiBuxhGAu8) to guide them through the test and document the test. 

The test was recorded via Zoom and uploaded to Google Drive and can be accessed [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15B-d7d-2xD6IH04DfzXphCHZDwuZ6O6N/view?usp=sharing)

## Assignment Reflection 
After conducting the experiment, I realized the importance of having steps for the user to follow when completing tasks. Initially when I was creating the survey to be used, I thought that including steps would defeat the purpose of the test because I wanted to see how the user would complete the task their own way. However, I now realize that having the steps is important because it allows us to analyze the usability of the site more clearly. 

I think that I was successful in creating tasks that users of the site would want to perform, which gave me valuable insight to how usable the site was. I think I also was able to develop tasks that tested the areas of the site that I found to be heuristically insufficient. While conducting the study, it was sometimes cumbersome to switch between multiple tabs since Zoom, the user's screen, and the survey need to be open at the same time, so I think having multiple monitors could help here. 

In the future, I think that I can improve by making the test more dialogue-like and remember to ask questions to the user throughout the test so that I can have more concise insight as to their experience navigating the site.
