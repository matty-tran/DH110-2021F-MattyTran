# DH110 assignment02 Usability Testing 

## Assignment Description 
In this assignment, I conducted a pilot usability test for the [Washington State Department of Transportation website.](https://wsdot.wa.gov/) 
The website contains infomation regarding the various forms of transportation in the state of Washington, including ferries, public transit, and automobiles. 
Participants were prompted to complete three tasks that simulated real-world tasks that users would perform. 
Prior to testing, the main usability issues were disorganization, sizing issues and mass text that makes searching for information diffcult, and lack of visual aids. 

The test was conducted online via Zoom where the participant shared their screen which was recorded. 
Participants also used a [Google form](https://forms.gle/6LXRowDsiBuxhGAu8) to guide them through the test and document the test. 

The test was recorded via Zoom and uploaded to Google Drive.
