#Assignment05: Personas and Scenarios 

## Digital Storytelling 

Digital storytelling is important because it allows us to focus primarily on the user. By understanding the user and their needs, we are able to create or improve a product in the most effective way. Through the storytelling we can convey our ideas to others and leave behind any biases from our interviews. 

## Proposed Features 

### 1. Future Trips 
As of now, users of the King County public transportation have to rely on two separate applications to plan their trips. Apple Maps and the King County website are used in conjunction, because although the Apple Maps app will plan the route, it does not show times outside of the near future, and so the King County website is referenced for the entire bus schedule. 
A helpful feature for users would be to add a "future trip" planner onto Apple Maps. Within this feature, users can select the date and time that they would like to arrive at their destination. Then, the user can view all teh various paths to take and finally "save" the route for the day of their trip. Consolidating the information from both sources gives the user an easier experience planning their trip, and allowing them to save the route allows them to perform the task in advance which could be very helpful. 

### 2. Mobile Pay 
On certain transportation modes such as the bus, purchasing a ride without a bus card can only be done with exact change. In the modern era where cash is seldom carried, and coins even more so, it can be inconvenient for people to take the bus, especially those who do not use it often. 
To solve this, payment can be integrated into the one item that users always have with them: their phone. By tapping into the mobile wallet function that is already present on most, if not all, smartphones, users can pay for their bus fare with a simple tap of their phone. Because of the digitized form of payment, the previous concern of exact change can be remedied.
