# Assignemnt03: Contextual Inquiry  

## Research Goals and Requirements 

1. The main activity that my projects seeks to support for users is using the [King County governmental website](https://kingcounty.gov/) to investigate how users search for information about public transportation. Specifically, the project will also inverstigate how users transition from physical ticketing to mobile options provided on the site.

2. The basic need for searching for transportation information is acccess to the website. For using the mobile app, users need to have a smartphone, which can be an Apple or Android product. 

3. Currently, users make use of physical cards or tickets to pay for their fare.
