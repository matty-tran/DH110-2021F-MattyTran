# assignment06: Interface Design 

## Summary 

The following is the initial interface design for a mobile wallet app that allows users to load their public transportation cards onto their phones. Once added, the user can readily access the card for tap payments, while also easily being able to manage the funds on their card. 

One of the major considerations while creating the user interface was accessibility, especially applicable to typography and color scheme. 

## Graphic Interface 

The interface design was modeled after Apple's wallet feature, primarily the wallet home page, as eventually I hope this feature would be integrated into existing mobile wallet applications. I wanted to keep the color scheme mostly minimal for accessibility purposes, but also because to make the focus colors stand out more, especially where they are used for buttons and icons. 

## Wireflow 

The wireflows/ low-fidelity prototype off of which this user interface is based can be found [here.](https://github.com/matty-tran/DH110-2021F-MattyTran/blob/main/assignment05/README.md)

N.B. only the mobile wallet user interface is detailed below, however, the map planner from the wireframes is not. 

## Design 

The following are the user interfaces for the mobile wallet application in dark and light modes.

### 1. Layout 

The first step that I took when I created the user interface was to create a grid layout to get a sense of the spacing of all my elements and how they would flow together on the page. Using the wireframes I had developed as a reference, I was able to choose the amount of space I wanted to include in the header and margins, and between elements so that all pages would have consistency.

### 2. System Design

When choosing the typography for my interface, I intially experimented with using different fonts for the header and body text. I was not able to find two fonts that I liked and felt harmonious, so I instead chose to convey the variation by making sure that the sizing was very distinct. I chose to make the body text 24pt because I thought that it looked best with the screen size I was using, and I made the header 48pt which is twice as large as the body text. Although I did not include any subtext or captions in my interface, I included it so that it could be referenced for future use.
