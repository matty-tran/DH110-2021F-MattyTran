# assignment07: High Fidelity Prototype 

## About the Prototype 

The purpose of the high fidelity prototype is to closely simulate the user's experience interacting with a product, by creating a product that close to its final stage. To achieve this, I used Figma's prototyping tools to create an interactive flow of my user interface. 

The interface that was modeled is the mobile wallet application that is used by residents of King County in Washington State to pay for their public transportation. This would replace the need to carry around their Orca Card and allows them to more easily manage the funds on their cards. 

[Orca Card Wallet Prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/ElWiKKAS014nyMBAoNTRj0/User-Interface?node-id=0%3A1) 

The prototype supports the following functions: 

1. Paying for transit fare using a tap-to-pay feature 
2. Viewing recent transactions of the card
3. Adding funds to the Orca card
