1. Washington State Board of Education

### This website is Washington State's website for the Board of Education. Primarily, this site is a resource for families, teachers, educators, and public schools in the state. 

### The site is well designed and provides an enjoyable user experience. Navigation of the site is easy, and finding target information can be done efficiently. No errors occurred during navigation. There are few critiques of this website. 

## Heuristic Analysis:

### 1. Visibility of System Status: 0
The user is able to tell if the system is functioning properly. 
When the site launches properly, there are large rotating images signal to the user that the website is live and functioning properly. I think this is an effective way to signal that the site is running properly without using an explicit message. 

### 2. Match Between System and Real World: 0
The system, though in a digital environment, behaves in ways that are similar to the real world.
The active tab on the site is highlighted (in this case darkened) which signals to the user where they are on the site. When cursing over tabs, the additional information drops down, as opposed to up or to the side, for example. 

### 3. User Control and Freedom: 0
The user is not restricted in navigating and using the system. 
The user has the ability to control the site, such as changing the language. This feature is presented at the top of the site. Navigation back and forth between pages is easy.

### 4. Consistency and Standards: 0
Common traits of the site do not contradict each other in design. 
The site is designed with a consisteny layout, color story, and typography. To the eye, the site is cohesive and there are no inconsistencies that are jarring to the user. 

### 5. Recognition Rather than Recall: 1
Navigation of the system does not require active effort on the part of the user, because the design aids in their use of the system. 
The site makes use of icons that for the most part are standard in their meaning or very clear. For example, the Twitter logo is used when mentioned, and graduation requirements being represented by a person in a cap and gown. Some icons are not as clear in their meaning, for example, "school improvement framework" being represented as bar graphs. 

### 6. Error Prevention: 0
The system is designed in a way that prevents any interruptions to the user's experience. 
While navigating the site, I did not experience any interruptions to my browsing, so I think the site properly meets this heuristic. 

### 7. Flexibility and Efficient Use: 0
The user can achieve the goals of the system quickly and without much effort. 
Many of the topics about which I tried to find information could be found with only a few gestures of interaction with the site. This tells me the the information and pages were organized in a way that makes the site very efficient. Complex topics and information can make use of the search bar which is conveniently located at the top of the site. 

### 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design: 0
The system is not designed in a way that overwhelms the user or is distracting. 
The site is consistent in the color palette, typography, and layout. Colors are mainly in the red family with some accents. There is only one source of images on the site, with the rest being simple icons. The layout contributes to an organized and uncluttered site. 

### 9. Help Users with Errors: 0
The system will provide the user with assistance and ways to resolve any errors that may occur. 
There were no errors that occurred with navigating the site, and I could not think of any ways to have an error present itself for testing, so this heuristic is left unevaluated. 

### 10. Help and Documentation: 0
The user is able to access information about the system itself. 
The website has an FAQ page that allows the user to answer any questions they may have.
