# a08: Pitch 

## Introduction

This application seeks to assist users who live in Washington State, specifically the King County area who use public transportation. As society modernizes and many commodities are digitized, public transportation ticketing still lags behind and remains physical. Especially in the context of COVID-19, it can be much more convenient for users to consolidate their public transportation ticketing and payments onto their mobile device. To this end, I created a mobile wallet application that allows users to connect their Orca Card (public transpotation payment card) to their phone, thus allowing the user to manage their funds and easily pay for their transit fare. 

## Design Statement

Through my design, I hoped to create a product that was intuitive and accessible to the user. I hope that this application helps to make the lives of users more convenient. 

## COntextual Inquiry

When conducting the contexual inquiry, I focused on Washington State's governmental website for the [Department of Transpotation.](https://kingcounty.gov/depts/transportation/metro.aspx) This gave me context as to how public transportation in the King County area works, as well as some of the struggles that users have in their daily lives. The two issues about which users had complaints were 1) a lack of sufficient information available on maps apps as well as the King County website, and 2) a reliance on the physical Orca Card and ticketing. The website claims that the Orca Card is something meant to be the "easiest, healthiest way to pay your transit fares..." This made me consider how an app could work with an Orca Card to create something that was truly easy and convenient for users.
