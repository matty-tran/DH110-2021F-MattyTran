# a08: Pitch 

## Introduction

This application seeks to assist users who live in Washington State, specifically the King County area who use public transportation. As society modernizes and many commodities are digitized, public transportation ticketing still lags behind and remains physical. Especially in the context of COVID-19, it can be much more convenient for users to consolidate their public transportation ticketing and payments onto their mobile device. To this end, I created a mobile wallet application that allows users to connect their Orca Card (public transpotation payment card) to their phone, thus allowing the user to manage their funds and easily pay for their transit fare. 

## Design Statement

Through my design, I hoped to create a product that was intuitive and accessible to the user. I hope that this application helps to make the lives of users more convenient, showing that good design can be a tool to help people in their lives.  

## Competitor Analysis 

When [reviewing Washington state's websites](https://github.com/matty-tran/DH110-2021F-MattyTran/blob/main/assignment01/assignment01.md) for the Department of Education and the Department of Transportation, I found a great amount of disparity of how well the two were designed. The Department of Education's website followed many of Nielson's 10 heuristics and was a very functional website. On the other hand, the Department of Transportation looked out-dated, and while conducting [usability testing](https://github.com/matty-tran/DH110-2021F-MattyTran/tree/main/assignment02) of the site, user's found the website difficult to navigate and took much longer than expected to complete some tasks. This gave me a clearer idea of what kinds of things user's expect when navigating to these sites. 

## User Research 

I focused on Washington State's governmental website for the [Department of Transpotation.](https://kingcounty.gov/depts/transportation/metro.aspx) This gave me context as to how public transportation in the King County area works, as well as some of the struggles that users have in their daily lives. The two issues about which users had complaints were 1) a lack of sufficient information available on maps apps as well as the King County website, and 2) a reliance on the physical Orca Card and ticketing. The website claims that the Orca Card is something meant to be the "easiest, healthiest way to pay your transit fares..." This made me consider how an app could work with an Orca Card to create something that was truly easy and convenient for users.

## UX Storytelling 

Using personas, scenarios, and empathy maps, we can take a step back from our position as a designer and try and understand the needs of our users. Doing so can allow us to remove any of the biases that we already have or developed during interviews or research. The main themes that came up across my personas and tasks was that users are concerned with environmentalism and convenience. As a group of people that takes public transportation regularly, users would prefer not to waste resources on constantly printing out transportation tickets. Additionally, people who are on a schedule to catch their public transportation may often be in a rush and forget their transportation card, in which case a digitized version would be very convenient for them. I kept these two ideas in mind when creating my product. [Read more...](https://github.com/matty-tran/DH110-2021F-MattyTran/tree/main/assignment04)

## Wireframing/ Low-Fidelity Prototype  

The product that I decided to develop for my users was a mobile wallet app that removes the need for users to carry around papaer tickets or their physical Orca Card. Instead, the card is linked to their mobile wallet, where the user can manage their funds and pay for their fare using tap-to-pay. The main functionality that I wanted to include in the app was: adding a card, adding money to their card, viewing transactions, and of course paying. The [wireframes](https://github.com/matty-tran/DH110-2021F-MattyTran/tree/main/assignment05) allow us to create a low-cost representation of what the product will be. In this stage, I think that it is most important to have a general sense of the flow of the app and a rough layout of the pages. 

## High-Fidelity Prototype 

After planning my product with wireframing and the low-fidelity prototype, I used Figma to create a [high-fidelity prototype](https://github.com/matty-tran/DH110-2021F-MattyTran/tree/main/assignment07) that was interactive. This step is very important because it gives us a strong sense of the product that the user will be directly using. Creating the interactive prototype is helpful because it helps us to account for all the possible pathways that a user may take and helps to avoid dead-ends. When creating the color scheme for my application, I chose a mostly monochromatic scheme that could be easily translated to light and dark modes. For the focus colors, I chose to use orange and blue because I thought they would be most friendly to color-blind users. Because of the monochromatic scheme, the contrast and readability of text passed [accessibility testing.](https://github.com/matty-tran/DH110-2021F-MattyTran/tree/main/assignment06)
