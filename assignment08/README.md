# a08: Pitch 

## Introduction

This application seeks to assist users who live in Washington State, specifically the King County area who use public transportation. As society modernizes and many commodities are digitized, public transportation ticketing still lags behind and remains physical. Especially in the context of COVID-19, it can be much more convenient for users to consolidate their public transportation ticketing and payments onto their mobile device. To this end, I created a mobile wallet application that allows users to connect their Orca Card (public transpotation payment card) to their phone, thus allowing the user to manage their funds and easily pay for their transit fare.
